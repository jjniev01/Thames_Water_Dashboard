# Thames_Water_Dashboard

Users will need a mapbox and Thames Water API tokens. The mapbox token should be pasted as a single line with no trailing or leading whitespace in the maboxtoken.txt file. The Thames Water API user id and token should be pasted into the TW_API_credentials.txt file. In this file the first line should be the user id and the second line (separated by a single carriage return) should have the API token.A
